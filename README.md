# Multibackuper

# WIP
## Do not use until next version, current 0.0.1


This application allows the user to clone a project into several folders to have it as a backup in case of HD error, system crash or whatever happen that result in the lost of the working directory.

## Features

* Watch mode, so you don't need to worry about hitting the **RUN** button after do some changes.
* Usb as storage.
* Multiple output directories, allowing you to have more than one copy.

### Clone

Multibackuper actually clone the project, it does not keep a history of previous changes so if watch mode is enabled modification are stored in real time meaning that revert is not possible from the backups.


## TODO

* Watcher still not done.


## Desirables

* Allow to save previous versions of the project.
* Start with OS.

## Installation

1. Download from /release:

## Usage
