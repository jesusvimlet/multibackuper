# Multibackup

* Usb as storage.
* Multiple output directories, allowing you to have more than one copy.
* Exclude directories from clone process.

### Clone

Multibackup actually clone the project, it does not keep a history of previous changes so if watch mode is enabled modification are stored in real time meaning that **revert is not possible from the backups**.


## Future updates
